# Assignment 4 - Writeup

In assignment 4 we created a basic tic tac toe game so that we could learn object oriented programming. Respond to the following questions.

## Reflection Questions

1. What was the most difficult part to tic-tac-toe?

creating the has won function just because of thinkin which if statements should fit for if the player has won

2. Explain how you would add a computer player to the game.

i would add a database of tictactoe plays/moves that the computer has access to and will search through the database to see what the next move it should do based on how the board looks

3. If you add a computer player, explain (doesn't have to be super technical) how you might get the computer player to play the best move every time. *Note - I am not grading this for a correct answer, I just want to know your thoughts on how you might accomplish it.

it could run a similation of what each move would do and determine the best move by whatever makes the oppent struggle the most and helps the computer win.
